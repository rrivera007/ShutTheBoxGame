# ShutTheBoxGame


The rules to the game are very simple. You roll two simulated die whose sum represents the target.

You are given numbers from 1-9, your goal is to take one or two numbers from the 1-9 range that makes it equal to the value of the target.

For example, let's say I roll two die: I get a 4 and a 3 which equals 7. Now from my numbers I can either pick just a 7 or I can pick a 4 and 3.
Once you have picked a number or numbers they stay down for good and can't be used again.

Additional rule: If you only have one number left to pick from in your 1-9 range then only one die is rolled.

The goal of the game is to try and get all of the numbers in your range without any left.
If there are any numbers left and you cannot proceed then your score is read from left to right depending on the numbers that are left!

The LOWER THE SCORE THE BETTER!!! Best Score=0 & Lowest Score=45



You have 3 tries then it's game over...if you cannot proceed any further then just input 3 mistakes and it's game over!!!
